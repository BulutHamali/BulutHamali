**`Genomic Voyager (Bioinformatician/Sea of Genes Explorer)`**

As a bioinformatician and molecular biologist, I've navigated the confluence of biology and technology from the early days of JavaScript to the cutting-edge of genomic research. With a PhD in Molecular Signal Transduction from the Medical University of Vienna, my career has been a journey of relentless curiosity and innovation. Each project I undertake, whether it's decoding genetic mysteries with R and Python or pioneering new lab techniques, is built from the ground up with meticulous care.

Today, I channel my passion into exploring the genetic factors behind diseases and sharing my findings with a broad audience. My work isn't just about advancing science; it's about building a bridge between complex bioinformatics concepts and practical, real-world applications.

As I continue to expand my digital and biological world, I invite you to join me on this journey of discovery. Let's explore the possibilities that lie at the intersection of computation and biology, making strides towards understanding life's complexities together.

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Dr. Hamali's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
My interest in programming began 20 years ago with JavaScript coding for website development, evolving into a deep commitment to bioinformatics and molecular biology over the past fourteen years. With a Ph.D. in Molecular Signal Transduction from the Medical University of Vienna, I've spent more than a decade applying bioinformatics tools and conducting wet lab research. My expertise spans programming languages (R, Python, SQL), bioinformatics platforms (Bioconductor, DESeq2), and laboratory techniques (CRISPR-Cas9, NGS), enabling me to lead interdisciplinary projects that merge computational analysis with empirical research.
I have consistently updated my skills to stay abreast of advancements in the field while mentoring junior scientists and contributing to the scientific community through publications and presentations. As a U.S. green card holder, I am well-positioned to lead and innovate in bioinformatics and molecular biology, with a keen interest in pursuing full-time bioinformatics roles and leading projects that require a blend of computational and laboratory expertise.
